Success! Congrats on defeating the enemy.

Not only have you gained experience, but also a knowledge fragment of Tyr's past.

Through this fragment, Tyr gets flashbacks of the old god of war in him ...

A cruel god who uses the throne to hold power over the Norse realms.

Yet... Prior to that, he was still the Tyr people loved and respected.


Tyr realizes that his terror over people, though intentional, came from an unresolved past that put him in this situation...

That unresolved past has yet to be discovered...
