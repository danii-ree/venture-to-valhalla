There was a god named Tyr who was respected amongst the mortals. 

He would fight for peace and stop those trying to disrupt it, and became 
part of the peacekeeping council consisted of gods who walk Tyr's path.

Despite his great reputation, he still hadn't forgotten his past. 

Believe it or not... Tyr used to bring terror to the nine realms and was considered:

The God of Destruction

He had difficulty choosing the right path. Thus, he chose to forge a new one.

Despite helping so many people in the nine realms, his shame still remained. 

To forget it permanently, he enters Valhalla to face his past self 
And get rid of the evils inside his mind.

It will be... 

Hard...

Painfull...

But he will get one step closer to...

Forging a new path...
