This is a tale like no other...
A tale that takes you on a journey full of mysterious adventures.

There was a god named Tyr who was respected amongst the mortals. 

He would fight for peace and stop those trying to disrupt it, and became 
part of the peacekeeping council consisted of gods who walk Tyr's path.

Despite his great reputation, he still hadn't forgotten his past. 

Believe it or not... Tyr used to bring terror to the nine realms and was considered:

The God of Destruction

He had difficulty choosing the right path. But after a long road, he forged a new one. 

Yet, the guilt still remained. 

To forget it permanently, he must enter Valhalla to face his past self and 
self-reflect on his choices.

It will be... 

Hard...

Painfull...

But he will get one step closer to...

Forging a new path...
