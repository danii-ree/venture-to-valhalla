Excellent Job!

You've defeated the enemies.

Now... Tyr sees a rune on the wall.

"
To be one's own master, master thyself.
For nothing is worse than a desecrated past.
Face the past, face the future.
Master valhalla, master thyself.
"

Tyr needs to face his past self to fully resurrect his self-esteem.
