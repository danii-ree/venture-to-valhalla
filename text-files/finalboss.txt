Excellent Job!

You've defeated the enemies.

Now... Tyr sees a rune on the wall.

"
To be one's own master, master thyself.
For nothing is worse than a desecrated past.
Face the past, face the future.
Master valhalla, master thyself.
"

Tyr needs to face his past self to fully resurrect his self-esteem.

You have now reached the end...

After fighting his past self, Tyr fully understood his past choices.

Despite his actions, Tyr realizes that those actions could have been averted
had he learned self-control. 

His decision to serve humanity afterwards shows progress. 

"Progress"

This is the rune he sees after defeating the boss.

Despite his wrongdoing, he made progress nonetheless. 

Tyr realizes that progress only comes when effort is put. Part of his effort of serving humanity shows progress on its own.

Valhalla isn't a place for challenge. It's a place for progress.

It goes through the deepest reaches of our memory to resolve the unresolvable.

Now it's your turn to do the same.

Valhalla Awaits!
